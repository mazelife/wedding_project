{% comment %}

This template provides for a special-case behavior in the case of runtime errors in view code.
If a view results in an exception, Django will show this template.

NB: The default 500 view passes *no* variables to this template and is rendered with an 
empty Context to lessen the chance of additional errors. This means that the 
variable is not available.
